Tag Reader for Home Asistant is the love child of Andrea Donno and Paulus Schoutsen. It is a custom built
RFID/NFC tag reader, specifically made as a stand-alone tag reader for.... You guessed it; [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io)

Although [Adonno](https://github.com/adonno) and [Balloob](https://github.com/balloob) are the Tag Readers' fathers, a lot of other people have helped out
by attributing code, testing 3D prints, coming up with better methods and being generally supportive! If you feel like you're one of the people
that have earned to be on this list, please feel free to add your name and know that we appreciate your effort! A list such as this is doomed to
have left someone out. For that, we're sorry! Add your name and forgive us the oversight!
